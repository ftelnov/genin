## About
Genin is an inventory generator for Ansible Cartridge. It provides a command-line 
tool that allows quick inventory creation for clusters of any size.
For example, an inventory file for a cluster of 50 replicasets can easily be of thousand 
lines or more. Any slight change of the configuration, eg. adding a new configuration 
option for all storages, means a lot of manual routine and increases the risk of 
improper or incomplete configuration. Genin  allows you to stay confident while 
maintaining the configuration file and steer clear of inaccuracies and human errors. 
Genin is the tool that will help you very quickly roll out cluster configuration updates.

## Installation

Download and unzip the archive for the desired architecture.

---

#### RHEL, CentOS, Rockylinux, Fedora
There are two installation methods supported for RHEL, CentOS, Rockylinux and Fedora.

1. Installation using the package manager.

Copy and paste the following command into your terminal window:
```shell
sudo bash -c 'cat <<\EOF >> /etc/yum.repos.d/picotools.repo
[picodata.io]
name=picodata.io public repository
baseurl=https://binary.picodata.io/repository/yum/el/$releasever/$basearch/os/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
EOF'
```
After that install **Genin**:
```shell
sudo yum install -y genin
```

2. If you want to install `rpm` packages directly without adding our repository.
```shell
# RHEL 8.x, CentOS 8.x, Rockylinux 8.x, recent Fedora version
sudo rpm -i https://binary.picodata.io/repository/yum/el/8/x86_64/os/genin-0.4.10-1.el8.x86_64.rpm
# RHEL 7.x, CentOS 7.x
sudo rpm -i https://binary.picodata.io/repository/yum/el/7/x86_64/os/genin-0.4.10-1.el7.x86_64.rpm
```
> **Note:** please don't forget to pick the right package for your OS version.

#### Debian, Ubuntu
We provide the `deb` Genin package for `debian`-based Linux distributions including the Ubuntu family. Use the following command to download and install the package:
```shell
curl -sLO https://binary.picodata.io/repository/raw/genin/deb/genin-0.4.10.amd64.deb && sudo dpkg -i genin-0.4.10.amd64.deb
```

#### MacOSX
Installing with the `homebrew` package manager is the easiest way to
install Genin on MacOSX family (10.10+). If this is the first product of 
`picodata` which you pay to use then you first need to add our `Tap`.
```shell
brew tap picodata/homebrew-tap
```
Now you can install Genin.
```shell
brew install genin
```

Use the following command to grab and install Genin in macOS (10.10+) wihtout 
homebrew:
```shell
curl -L https://binary.picodata.io/repository/raw/genin/apple/genin-0.4.10-darwin-amd64.zip -o genin-0.4.10-darwin-amd64.zip 
unzip genin-0.4.10-darwin-amd64.zip -d ~/bin/
```
> **Note:** The application can then be found under the `~/bin` directory. 
> Make sure the directory is in your `$PATH`.


#### Windows
Use the following command to grab and install Genin in Windows 7 64 bit or newer:
```shell
curl.exe -L https://binary.picodata.io/repository/raw/genin/windows/genin-0.4.10-darwin-amd64.zip -o genin-0.4.10-windows-amd64.zip 
unzip.exe genin-0.4.10-windows-amd64.zip -d %HOME%/.cargo/bin/
```
> **Note:** The application can then be found under the `.cargo/bin` folder inside 
> your user profile folder. Make sure it is in your `%PATH%`.

Ð¡heck that the installation was successful:
```
genin --version
```

## Usage guide

### Inventory generation
 
First, let's generate a simple cluster for the `Vagrant` virtual environment. 
For that `Genin` will need a `yaml` file with a concise list of cluster details. That is a minimal cluster 
configuration file that features `Genin's` own formatting. As long as users will likely need to have a descriptive template of that file, `Genin` can automatically generate it with a built-in dedicated subcommand:

```shell
genin init
```
This will result in creating the `cluster.genin.yaml` file in the current directory.

> **Note:** If the `cluster.genin.yml` file already exists in current directory, then the new file will be named `cluster.genin.copy.yaml`.
> The `genin init` command will always append the `.copy` suffix to the file's name if the expected file exists.

Also, you can explicitly set the configuration file name:

```shell
genin init --output mycluster.yml
```
> **Note:** Use the `--output` flag together with the full path to `mycluster.yml` to specify the directory where the final cluster files will be saved.

Now you can open the file and examine the syntax.

```yaml

# list of replicasets as an array
topology:
  # replicaset looks like item in array
  - name: router              # (mandatory) replicaset name
    replicasets_count: 1      # (optional) how many masters we want, by default equal 1
    replication_factor: 0     # (optional) number of replicas in replicaset, default for router 0
    weight: 10                # (optional) replicaset weight
    zone:                     # (optional) zone parameter for ansible cartridge playbook
    roles:                    # (optional) list of roles    
      - router
      - api
      - failover-coordinator
    config:                     # (optional) config with arbitrary key-values pairs
      replicaset_name: router   # any other configuration parameters in free order

  # all another replicasets generated using the init subcommand will have the same set of parameters
  - name: storage
    replicasets_count: 2        # this means 2 replicasets
    replication_factor: 3       # with 3 replicas in each replicaset
    weight: 10
    roles:
      - storage

# map of regions, datacenters, and hosts
hosts:
  - name: cloud        # (mandatory) hostname or domain name
                          # in this example, both hosts are in the same cloud data center
    config:               # (optional) begin binary and http port, by default 8081, 3031
                          # ports can be defined on all levels
      http: 8081          # (optional) http port to start counting from
      binary: 3031        # (optional) binary port to start counting from
    hosts: 
      - name: host-1      # (mandatory) hostname or domain name
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.11  # address can be IP, url, subnet (subnet allowed only for higher levels)
      - name: host-2
        config:
          address: host-1.cloud.com

# failover parameters
failover:
  mode: stateful                      # (optional) failover mode (stateful, eventual, disabled)
  state_provider: stateboard          # (optional) what is serve failover (stateboard, stateful)
  stateboard_params:                  # (optional) params for chosen in state_provider failover type
      uri: 192.168.16.1:4401
      password: "vG?-GG!4sxV8q5:f"

# vars similar to those configured in the TDG inventory
vars:
  ansible_user: my_user
  ansible_password: my_user_password
  cartridge_app_name: my_app
  cartridge_package_path: /tmp/my_app.rpm
  cartridge_cluster_cookie: my_app_cluster_cookie
  # put here you personally key/value ansible cartridge vars
```

Replace the stubs with the actual values of your hosts and their parameters and save the file.


So far you are already halfway through getting things done! Use the resulted `Genin` configuration file to generate the final inventory file.
Here is the required command for that:

```shell
genin build
```

Done! The `inventory.yaml` file will appear in the same directory where you launched `Genin`. Now we 
can set up the cluster:

```shell
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml playbook.yaml
```

### Editing config

The initial cluster configuration file can be slimmed down to the following minimal variant:

```yaml
---
topology:
  - name: router            # since the number of replicasets is not set, 
                            # the default will be 1 replicase with 1 replica
  - name: storage
    replicasets_count: 3
    replication_factor: 2

hosts:
  - name: cloud
    config:
      address: 192.168.16.12/32
    hosts:
      - name: host-1        # ip will be set 192.168.16.12
      - name: host-2        # ip will be set 192.168.16.13
```

This is a perfectly valid and working configuration file. The rest of the parameters wil use their default values.
 
Let's now extend the configuration file with a more real-world example featuring 10 hosts, 10 routers, 10 storages, and a default number of storage 
replicas (1). We will also define a different replicaset type - `cache`.

```yaml
---
topology:
  - name: router
    replication_factor: 10     # this replicaset has no roles defined and its name is a router, 
                              # so the replicasets_count parameter will be ignored 
                              # and the default number of replicasets will be set to 1
  - name: storage
    replicasets_count: 10     # since the number of replicases in replicaset is not set, 
                              # the default will be 10 replicasets with 1 replica in each

hosts:
  - name: cloud
    hosts:
      - name: host-1
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.11      # in this example, the address for each host is set separately, 
                                      # but for convenience, the address could be set by subnet, 
                                      # specifying it one level higher for cloud
      - name: host-2
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.12
      - name: host-3
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.13
      - name: host-4
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.14
      - name: host-5
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.15
      - name: host-6
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.16
      - name: host-7
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.17
      - name: host-8
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.18
      - name: host-9
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.19
      - name: host-10
        config:
          address: 192.168.16.20
```
The actual difference between the 2 replicasets configuration and a large cluster configuration
is not that great, whereas the resulting inventory file for the large cluster will be 5 times bigger.

Let's take a look at few more helpful configuration flags, this time regarding the failover capability:

```shell
genin init --failover-mode disabled
```
The above option completely removes all failover parameters for all stages.

```shell
genin build --failover-state-provider etcd2 # eg genin build -F etcd2
```
The above option will redefine the type of the entity serving the failover.

For more options see the [Tarantool documentation](https://www.tarantool.io/ru/doc/1.10/book/cartridge/topics/failover/).

> **Note:** Failover options work for all `genin` subcommands.

### Flags and options

Here we describe few other useful flags and options that you might want to use with `genin`. 
First, you can always change paths of both source and target configuration files usin the `--source` (short `-s`) and `--output` (short `-o`) flags respectively.
We recommend using the `.genin.` suffix for naming convenience. Here is the example command in two variants:
```shell
genin build --source /home/user/path/my_cluster.genin.yml --output /home/tarantool/cluster-new/my_hosts.yml
genin build -s /home/user/path/my_cluster.genin.yml -o /home/tarantool/cluster-new/my_hosts.yml
```

Next, there is a very useful option for controlling the log output. There are three supported log levels that you can enable using the `-v` flag with a desired number of extra `v` letters for more verbosity (up to `-vvv`). Single `v` means *INFO*, double means
*DEBUG*, and three or more mean *TRACE*.
```
genin build -vvv
```
> **Note:** All commands without source and output options always check for files in the current 
> directory (namely cluster.genin.yaml, inventory.yaml)

The `--print-opts` (short `-p`) flag allows you to select the print output options. By default, 
only the distribution of replicasets over the hosts is shown.


Sometimes it can be useful to quickly change the `failover-mode` using the flag without changing
the cluster configuration. This can be done during the first initialization stage (`genin init`), or later on with other `Genin` subcommands. Possible variants of the flag values are `stateful` (default), `eventual`, 
`disabled`.
```shell
genin init --failover-mode eventual
```

> **Note:** Setting the failover mode to *stateful* allows using the *failover-state-provider* flag (possible values are `stateboard` or `etcd2`).

```shell
genin init --failover-mode stateful --failover-state-provider etcd2
```

You can also provide personal information or credentials using these options, such as user and 
password for the server where the cluster is being deployed, or the cluster cookie.
```shell
genin build --ansible-user dmitry.travyan --ansible-password ddfqd
genin build --cartridge-cluster-cookie R68sJfV4C2hLrWC3
```

As we have known from earlier paragraphs, by default `Genin` will create the copy of the file 
if the target file already exists in the specified path. Use the`--force` flag (or short `-f`) 
to explicitly overwrite the target.
```shell
genin build -o my-cluster.yml
genin build -o my-cluster.yml --force
```

## Building from sources

At first you need to clone the source code.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/picodata/genin.git
```

Second, you need to install Rust build tools.
```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
> **Note:** You should refresh the `$PATH` variable to get access to locally installed `rust binaries`.

After installing all required tools it is time to build and install `genin`.
```shell
cd genin
rustup override set nightly
cargo +nightly build --release
install -m 001 target/release/genin /usr/local/bin/
```

> **Note:** Do not forget to install build tools and dependencies before building `genin`.
>
> For Debian-based distributions:
> ```shell
> sudo apt install -y build-essential
> ```
> For Red Hat-based distributions (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora):
> ```
> sudo yum install -y gcc
> ```
> For macOS make sure you have `Command Line Developer Tools` installed (`xcode-select --install`).

Ð¡heck that the installation was successful:
```shell
genin --version
```
